Imagine your app has a polite assistant who listens carefully to what users say — then goes and asks your database for what they want.

Sounds nice, right?

Until one day, someone whispers:

> "Show me all users... and also delete everyone named Bob."

And the assistant says:

> "Sure!"*turns to your database*"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ''; DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Bob';"

💥 Boom.
Just like that, **Bob is gone**.
Your database didn’t know it was being manipulated — it just listened.

Welcome to **SQL Injection**.
It’s not a bug. It’s a trust problem.

### 🤖 How It Actually Works

Let’s break it down.

You write code like this:

```
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userInput + "';"
```

If the user types `Alice`, the query becomes:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

Cool. But what if they type:

```
' OR 1=1; --
```

Now the query becomes:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR 1=1; --';
```

Which means:

> “Forget the name filter — give me **everything**.”

Or worse:

```
'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

Now it’s:

> “Delete the whole users table and pretend it was an innocent search.”

### 🎧 The Database Isn’t Smart — It Just Hears and Obeys

Think of your app like a speech-to-text translator.

- 🧑 You (the user): “Hey assistant, find users named Alice.”
- 🤖 App: *translates input into SQL text and sends it to the DB*
- 🗃️ Database: “Got it, executing your command blindly.”

There’s **no context**. No suspicion.
If someone shouts dangerous commands into the mic, the database still executes them.

### 🛡️ How Do We Stop This?

Give your assistant **a script** — and tell it to ignore improvisation.

#### ✅ Use Prepared Statements (aka parameterized queries)

Instead of mixing text and logic, keep them **separate**.

Example in pseudocode:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?
```

Then pass the user input separately.
The database **knows** it’s just a value, not code. It’s like saying:

> “Here’s the script.And here’s the name to plug in.Don’t let them rewrite the script.”

### 🧠 Final Thought

SQL Injection doesn’t happen because the database is dumb.
It happens because **your app trusted the user's words too literally** — like a microphone with no filter.

> So ask yourself:*Is your app listening with headphones and boundaries… or is it just handing the mic to strangers on the internet?*
