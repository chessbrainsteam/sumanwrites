It’s a question that pops up often—especially among new managers or those eyeing leadership roles:

> **“Do I *****have***** to code if I’m a manager?”**

Short answer?
**No, but you probably should.**

Let’s talk about why.

### 🧭 Leadership Isn’t Just About Code

Being a good engineering manager is about **people**, **priorities**, and **product impact**. Your main job is to:

- Unblock your team
- Align with product and business goals
- Coach and grow engineers
- Make smart decisions under pressure
- Create a culture where people do their best work

You don’t need to merge pull requests daily to do these things well.

### 💡 But Here’s the Catch...

When you understand the tech deeply enough to *talk the talk* and *think through architecture*, you gain:

- 🧠 **Credibility**: Your team respects that you *get it*.
- 🔍 **Clarity**: You can assess estimates, risks, and complexity more accurately.
- 🤝 **Trust**: You speak the same language as your engineers and your stakeholders.

You don’t have to write code full-time.
But you should *understand* it—enough to challenge ideas, spot red flags, and support sound decisions.

### 🛠️ When Managers Should Still Code

Not every org expects it. But here are cases where coding as a manager makes a lot of sense:

- 🚨 You're in a **startup or small team** and need to get your hands dirty.
- 🧪 You’re **prototyping ideas** to help product/design move faster.
- 🧠 You want to **stay sharp** and connected to the craft.
- 🚧 You're **filling in gaps** while hiring (yes, we’ve all been there).

### 🚫 When You Shouldn’t Code

- ❌ When it becomes a distraction from leading.
- ❌ When you start hoarding the fun tickets and leave the team with bugs.
- ❌ When it prevents someone else on the team from growing.

Leading is its own full-time job.
You don’t want to be **half-engineer, half-manager, fully-burnt-out**.

### ✅ The Balanced Approach

Here’s what’s worked for me and many others:

> 💬 **Code less, think technically more.**

- Review architecture docs.
- Sit in design reviews.
- Occasionally read PRs, offer guidance.
- Write a spike or internal tool when time permits.

You’re not proving yourself through code anymore—you’re multiplying others through clarity and context.

### 🧠 Final Thought

Do you need to code as a manager?
**Not always. But it helps.**

Think of it like speaking a language.
You don’t have to be a poet—but if you want to lead in that country, you better be fluent enough to be understood.
