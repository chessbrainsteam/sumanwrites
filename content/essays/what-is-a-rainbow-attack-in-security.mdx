Let’s say you forget your email password. You type in “reset,” and the system sends you a link—not your actual password—because **your password is stored as a hash**, not in plain text. That’s good security.

But what if a hacker steals the **hashed passwords** from a database?
They can’t *see* your password directly, but with a technique called a **rainbow attack**, they might still figure it out.

## 🔐 Hashing: The One-Way Lock

A **hash function** takes your password (like `sunshine123`) and turns it into a fixed string of characters like:

```
sunshine123 → 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
```

The key thing?
You can go from password → hash,
but **not** from hash → password (at least, not easily).

## 🌈 Enter: The Rainbow Table

Now imagine a hacker pre-computes the hashes of **millions of common passwords** and stores them in a huge lookup table:

123456 →  e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e

password  →  5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

sunshine123 →  5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

If the hacker sees a hash in your system that matches one in their rainbow table, they instantly know the password.

That’s a **rainbow attack**—fast, clever, and deadly if you don’t defend properly.

## 🧂 The Hero: Salt

A **salt** is a random string added to your password *before hashing*.
So `sunshine123` + `Xyz1@` → a completely different hash.

Even if two people have the same password, the hash will look different due to the unique salt.

### Without salt:

- User A & User B use 123456 → same hash

### With salt:

- User A: 123456 + x1 → hashA
- User B: 123456 + y7 → hashB
- ✅ No rainbow table can predict that

## 🧠 In Summary

- 🔒 Passwords are stored as hashes so they’re not readable.
- 🌈 Rainbow attacks use massive tables of precomputed hashes to reverse-guess passwords.
- 🧂 Salting passwords makes rainbow tables **useless** by making each hash unique.
