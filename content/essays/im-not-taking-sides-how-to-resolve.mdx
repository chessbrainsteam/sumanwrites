Every manager eventually gets the knock.
Two team members. One tension.
They both say:

> “Can I talk to you for a minute?”

And you already know — this isn’t about sprint planning.

It’s about a disagreement.
A misunderstanding.
Or worse: silence, assumptions, and passive friction that’s slowing the team down.

### 🧠 What Not to Do:

**Don’t jump in with the solution — even if it’s obvious.**

> That’s the biggest trap: trying to *solve* the conflict like a bug in production.But humans aren’t functions.And most conflicts aren’t about facts — they’re about **interpretation**, **tone**, and **ownership**.

### ✅ So What Should You Do?

You create a space where resolution can *happen* — **without fear**, **without blame**, and **without sides**.

Here’s how:

### 1. Create a neutral room, not a courtroom

Don’t position yourself as the judge.
Instead, be the host of a space where both people feel:

- Safe
- Heard
- Not under a spotlight

> “I’m here to understand — not to assign blame.”That one sentence opens the door.

### 2. Don’t paraphrase — facilitate directly

Avoid becoming the messenger:

> “So what I’m hearing is… you feel he didn’t include you.”

Instead, say:

> “Would you mind explaining that to her directly?”

Make **them** speak to each other — not to you.

This keeps the **ownership of communication** where it belongs.

### 3. Don’t offer the fix (yet)

Even if you know the answer — **don’t solve it for them**.
Why?

Because that:

- Robs them of learning how to work through discomfort
- Makes you the dependency
- Makes one side feel “overruled”

Instead, ask:

> “What do you think would make this better?”“How do you want to move forward?”“What does resolution look like for both of you?”

Let them build the bridge.

### 4. Model respect and calm

Even if voices rise — don’t match the energy.
Hold steady.
Stay curious.

If needed, pause and say:

> “Let’s slow down — I want to make sure we’re focused on understanding, not winning.”

Conflict feels hot.
Resolution happens when someone brings the temperature down.

### 5. Follow up — but don’t babysit

After the talk, check in privately:

> “How are things feeling after the discussion?”

Don’t hover.
Don’t rehash.
Just stay **available** and **accountable**.

If things improve, call it out:

> “I noticed you both collaborated really well on that last ticket — appreciate the reset.”

### 🧠 Final Thought

Resolving conflict isn’t about fixing people.
It’s about **creating a space where people feel safe enough to fix things together**.

You’re not the referee.
You’re the facilitator of trust.

And sometimes, the most powerful thing you can say as a leader is:

> “I’m not here to decide who’s right — I’m here to help us move forward.”
