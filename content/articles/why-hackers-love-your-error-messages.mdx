Imagine you're standing at a locked door.
You try the knob. It doesn’t open.
Suddenly, a loudspeaker says:

> ❗“Access denied: incorrect key. But here’s what we were expecting — something exactly 16 characters, starting with ‘X’.”

You didn’t get in…
but wow, **you learned a lot**.

That’s what **error messages** can do when they’re written for developers — and **shown to everyone**.

And hackers?
They love them.
Because every error message is like a tiny **glimpse behind the curtain**.

### 💥 What’s the Risk?

When your app spits out detailed errors like:

```
SQLException: syntax error near 'DROP'
```

or

```
Stack trace: NullReferenceException in UserController.java:84
```

…you’re doing three things:

1. Confirming what tech stack you use
2. Revealing internal file structures and code paths
3. Telling the attacker **exactly where things went wrong**

You’ve just become an **open book** with all the answers in the back.

### 🧠 Why It Happens

- You're in dev mode.
- You want clear errors for debugging.
- The framework helpfully shows the full stack trace.
- You forget to switch to prod mode.
- Suddenly, you're explaining your whole backend to anyone who asks rudely.

> It's like posting your home security code on the front door — but in YAML.

### 🧪 Real Example

Let’s say someone tries to log in with weird input:

```
Username: '; DROP TABLE users; --
```

If you respond with:

```
500 Internal Server Error SQL error: unexpected 'DROP' near line 1
```

That’s gold.

Now the attacker knows:

- You use SQL
- You're not sanitizing input
- Their injection attempt is *close*

They’ll tweak and try again.
You're practically coaching them.

### 🛡️ So What Should You Do?

#### ✅ 1. Show generic errors to users

Instead of saying:

> Exception: invalid token structure in AuthModule.java

Say:

> Something went wrong. Please try again.

Save the details for the logs.

#### ✅ 2. Log everything — but securely

- Include full error traces in your logs
- Make sure logs are only accessible internally
- Don’t log sensitive values like passwords or full tokens

#### ✅ 3. Disable verbose mode in production

Most frameworks have a flag:

```
app.set('env', 'production');
```

or

```
DEBUG = False
```

That alone can hide stack traces from the outside world.

### 🚨 Bonus Tip: Watch Your APIs

Even APIs return verbose errors:

```
{ "error": "Invalid JWT signature", "stack": "at auth.verifyToken (/utils/token.js:32:17)..." }
```

Instead, return:

```
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

Let your logs tell the full story — not the response body.

### 🧠 Final Thought

Your error messages were written to help you.
But when left exposed, they help the wrong people.

> Be generous in your logs.Be vague in your responses.And remember — the less you say in public, the safer you stay.
