We love the big leadership moments.

The offsites.  
The town halls.  
The “Let’s realign our mission” slides with dramatic fonts.

But the truth?  
**Culture isn’t built in keynotes. It’s built in 90 seconds.**

## 🧠 The Rule

If you can make one person feel seen, heard, or encouraged in 90 seconds,  
you’ve done more for your culture than a 90-minute meeting ever will.

That’s the **90-Second Leadership Rule** —  
because leadership isn’t about *presence on stage*; it’s about *presence in passing.*

## 💬 Micro-Moments, Mega-Impact

Think about it.

That quick Slack message saying,  
> “Loved how you handled that client call.”  

That hallway nod that says,  
> “You’ve got this.”  

That moment before a meeting when you ask,  
> “Hey, how’s your kid doing after the move?”  

Tiny, forgettable to you.  
Unforgettable to them.

These are the quiet deposits in the **trust account** of your team.

## 🪞 Why It Works

People don’t remember your strategy slides.  
They remember how they felt when you talked to them.

- A 90-second check-in breaks silence before burnout sets in.  
- A 90-second “thank you” keeps motivation alive.  
- A 90-second curiosity question sparks belonging.

Leadership isn’t a broadcast — it’s a heartbeat.

## 🧭 The Myth of the Big Moment

We overestimate the impact of big speeches  
and underestimate the power of small sentences.

The quarterly all-hands might inspire.  
But daily micro-moments sustain.

You can’t scale connection through a calendar invite.  
You scale it through consistency.

---

## ☕ The Practice

Here’s how to apply the 90-Second Rule:

1. **Start each day with one deliberate moment of connection.**  
   A ping, a compliment, or a curious question.  

2. **Be specific.**  
   “Good job” is noise.  
   “That fix in yesterday’s PR was elegant” is memory.  

3. **End meetings like a human.**  
   Not with “any questions?” but with “any blockers?”  
   One builds silence. The other builds safety.

4. **Don’t schedule it.**  
   Spontaneity beats structure.  
   People feel authenticity, not calendar slots.

## 🕰️ Why 90 Seconds?

Because that’s all it takes before Slack pings, calendars hijack, and life resumes.  
You don’t need long — just **real**.

It’s not about length.  
It’s about *intent.*  
A 90-second conversation can rewrite someone’s day — or their confidence.

---

## 💡 The Takeaway

Leadership isn’t built on grand moments.  
It’s built on **micro-moments of humanity.**

Every time you pause to connect, you’re reinforcing a message:  
> “You matter more than the metrics.”

And that’s the kind of culture people remember —  
not because it’s loud, but because it’s *lasting.*

---

🕰️ *You can’t schedule culture. You create it — 90 seconds at a time.*
