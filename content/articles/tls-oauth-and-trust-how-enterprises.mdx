When we think of securing APIs, we often hear buzzwords like **OAuth2**, **mTLS**, or **TLS encryption**. But what’s rarely talked about is what happens *behind the scenes* — how enterprises actually exchange certificates and keys, how trust is established between systems, and how real-world flows differ between **OAuth1** and **OAuth2**.

In this post, I’ll walk through how large organizations — especially in fintech and payments — manage **certificate-based security** during onboarding. We’ll cover how **TLS**, **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, and **OAuth** come together to enable secure communication between enterprise systems.

# First Comes Trust: TLS and mTLS Setup

In any secure API communication, the **TLS handshake** is the starting point.

- The **server** shares its **public certificate** — this allows the client to verify it’s connecting to the right host.
- The **client** stores this cert in its **trust store** (Java keystore, JKS, PEM file, etc.).
- With **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, the client also presents its **own certificate** during the handshake.
- The **server must trust the client cert**, either by trusting the CA that issued it or by explicitly storing it.

# How certificates are exchanged:

In most enterprise onboarding flows:

- A secure **partner portal** is used to download server and client certs.
- The client might be asked to upload their public cert ahead of time.
- Certificates are manually added to **trust stores** or **API Gateway configurations**.

> *⚠️ Tip: Missing intermediate certs or wrong formats (*PEM* vs. *DER*) are common onboarding issues.*

# OAuth1 Signing: Where Keys Come In

OAuth1 is still alive in many banking, government, and legacy systems. It’s different from OAuth2 because it uses **cryptographic request signing** rather than access tokens.

# How OAuth1 works in practice:

- The client downloads a .p12** file**, which contains:
- A **private key** used to **sign each request** (using RSA-SHA1)
- A **client certificate** (optional, for mTLS)
- The server stores the **client’s public key** in a secure key registry or config.
- When the client sends an API request:
- It signs the request using OAuth1 parameters:

```
oauth_consumer_key, oauth_nonce, oauth_signature_method, oauth_timestamp, oauth_version, oauth_signature
```

- The server verifies the signature using the stored public key.
- This signature ensures **non-repudiation** — the client cannot deny having sent the request.

# Example: A Real-World Enterprise Setup

Let’s walk through what a real onboarding flow might look like:

1. Client logs into the onboarding portal.
2. Downloads:

- .p12 file containing their **private signing key** and **client certificate**
- .pem file containing the **server’s TLS certificate**

3. Client:

- Uses server’s .pem to validate the HTTPS connection (TLS)
- Uses .p12 to:
- Authenticate via mTLS
- Sign API requests using OAuth1

4. Server:

- Verifies mTLS using the client cert
- Verifies the OAuth1 signature using the registered client public key

# OAuth2: Simpler, But With Its Own Rules

OAuth2 replaced OAuth1 in many systems by introducing **access tokens**. Instead of signing each request, the client retrieves a token from an **Authorization Server** and presents it like a digital pass.

# Standard OAuth2 Flow:

1. Client authenticates with client_id and client_secret, or via mTLS.
2. Gets an access_token from the Auth Server.
3. Sends the token with each request:

```
Authorization: Bearer 
```

4. API Gateway or backend validates the token:

- Either by introspection (/token/introspect)
- Or by validating the JWT signature

# Certificates and OAuth2?

- TLS is mandatory to protect tokens in transit.
- mTLS may be used to authenticate the client during the token request (especially in FAPI-compliant environments).
- No request signing is needed like in OAuth1 — **bearer tokens are simpler** but also **easier to misuse if leaked**.

# Best Practices From the Field

Here are a few hard-earned lessons:

- **Separate key material for TLS and OAuth1**Don’t reuse the same .p12 or private key for both purposes. Use **independent certs/keys** to isolate rotation and minimize security risk.
- **Track cert expiration dates proactively**Downtime due to expired certs happens more often than we’d like to admit.
- **Use a key vault**Don’t store private keys in code or flat config files. Use a centralized solution like **AWS Secrets Manager**, **Azure Key Vault**, or **HashiCorp Vault**.
- **Automate rotation and onboarding**Manual cert exchange and key registration leads to inconsistency and human error. Where possible, automate onboarding via API.
- **Test negative scenarios**Always test how your system behaves with expired certs, invalid signatures, and revoked tokens.

# Final Thoughts

Whether you’re implementing **OAuth1 with request signatures** or **OAuth2 with tokens**, it all begins with trust — and that trust is built on **certificates**, **keys**, and **secure exchange practices**.

In fintech and other security-sensitive domains, taking the time to understand these flows can make the difference between a **robust integration** and a **nightmare in production**.
